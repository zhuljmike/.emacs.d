2019-02-24  Justin Burkett  <justin@burkett.cc>

	Version 3.1.0

2017-12-17  Justin Burkett  <justin@burkett.cc>

	Fix and improve define-key based replacements

	Check for equality of definition as well as the key sequence. Unless
	it's a prefix binding, in which case only check the key sequence.

	Make sure we apply kbd when looking up pseudo bindings.

	Move the logic into which-key--get-pseudo-binding.

2017-12-17  Jonas Bernoulli  <jonas@bernoul.li>

	Define which-key--current-key-list before using it

	Actually move the definition of the caller which-key--pseudo-key 
	instead.

2017-12-16  Justin Burkett  <justin@burkett.cc>

	Simplify implementation of define-key based replacements

	When a description is provided through define-key using a definition 
	like ("description" . def) place a additional binding in the map to a
	"pseudo key" making it easy for which-key to find these descriptions on
	the fly and at the right time (i.e., when the binding is active).

	which-key-enable-extended-define-key must be enabled for this to have an 
	effect.

2017-12-15  Justin Burkett  <justin@burkett.cc>

	Improve which-key--process-define-key-args

	Specify Prefix Command as an explicit match string to cut down on false

2017-12-13  Justin Burkett  <justin@burkett.cc>

	Allow null DEF in which-key--process-define-key-args

	This is useful for naming prefixes

2017-12-13  Justin Burkett  <justin@burkett.cc>

	Add which-key-enable-extended-define-key customization option

	Adds supporting which-key--process-define-key-args.

	The docstring for the option is

	Advise `define-key' to make which-key aware of definitions of the form

	  (define-key KEYMAP KEY '("DESCRIPTION" . DEF))

	With the advice, this definition will have the side effect of creating a 
	replacement in `which-key-replacement-alist' that replaces DEF with
	DESCRIPTION when the key sequence ends in KEY. Using a cons cell like
	this is a valid definition for `define-key'. All this does is to make
	which-key aware of it.

	Since many higher level keybinding functions use `define-key'
	internally, this will affect most if not all of those as well.

	This variable must be set before loading which-key.

2017-12-07  Justin Burkett  <justin@burkett.cc>

	Fix ordering of default replacement-alist

	When which-key-allow-multiple-replacements is nil, this order is
	required to get the intended behavior with left and right.

	Add which-key-show-major-mode

	This is a new function to discover bindings, including evil ones, in the
	keymap of the current major mode. It should be considered experimental
	at the moment.

	Replace role of show-next-page with C-h-dispatch which immediately reads 
	a key and calls a command from C-h-map, which may be one of several 
	paging commands, a command to undo the last keypress, or a command to 
	directly access describe-prefix-bindings.

	This commit does not include documenting these changes in the readme.

	the same (if any effect).

	Use key-description for canonical keys

	This takes the idea in the previous commit and translates the 
	representations of keys in the alists to be the output of 
	key-description. The issue is that `M-x` for example has two 
	representations with listify-key-sequence, but only one (it seems) from 
	key-description.

2015-11-28  Chris Perkins  <chrisperkins99@gmail.com>

	Display prefix names in terminal-mode

	When running emacs in a terminal (or at least, in iTerm), keys are not 
	passed through to emacs the same way that they are in graphical mode.

	For example, M-m (important in spacemacs) is the key-sequence
	`[134217837]` in graphical emacs, but `[27 109]` ("ESC m") in terminal.

	The variable `which-key-prefix-name-alst` only has a mapping for the 
	former (the 134217837), and so the names of submenus all show up as
	"+prefix", limiting discoverability.

	This commit converts the key sequence into a canonical form (eg: 
	converts `[27 109]` into `[134217837]`) in
	`which-key--maybe-replace-prefix-name`, so that the prefixes are found.

	I think some work is probably needed for
	`which-key-prefix-title-alist` too, but I'm not entirely sure what 
	that's used for, so I didn't mess with it.

	Provide alternative for prefix-title

	If echo-keystrokes is non nil, we're showing in the bottom window, and

	Refactor show-next-page

2015-10-03  justbur  <justin@burkett.cc>

	Move golden-ratio-mode let binding

	Let bind golden-ratio-mode earlier in show-page function which may help 
	prevent golden-ratio from moving the whihc-key buffer

2015-10-02  Iqbal Ansari  <iqbalansari02@yahoo.com>

	Do not display which-key popup if an interactive command is in progress

	This prevents the which-key popup from being displayed if
	`read-key-sequence` is invoked from a command as opposed to the editor's 
	main loop.

	The changes introduced in #b96481 and #6d20c0 have been removed since 
	they are not needed now

2015-10-02  justbur  <justin@burkett.cc>

	Better fix for #65

	Go back to using the original strategy of backing up

	`which-key-show-next-page`.

2015-09-23  justbur  <justin@burkett.cc>

	Fix #65

	Don't try to backup the value of `prefix-help-command` because it was 
	getting set to `which-key-show-next-page` somehow creating an infinite 
	recursion error. Just call `describe-prefix-bindings` directly, which 
	should cover almost all cases.

	Frame popup support and some small fixes

	Summary of changes:
	- add emacs 24.3 as a dependency, because
	 `display-buffer-in-major-side-window` doesn't exist in older emacsen
	- add option to show which-key buffer in a popup frame
	 `(setq which-key-popup-type 'frame)`
	- stop close timer when disabling which-key-mode
	- don't hide which-key buffer before showing it. instead, show methods
	 handle the case that the buffer is already shown
	- `which-key/hide-popup` calls function depending on popup
	 type (similar to `which-key/show-popup`)
	- use `display-buffer-in-major-side-window` instead of
	 `display-buffer-in-side-window`, for popup type side-window. ensures
	 new side window is created properly even if other side windows already
	 exist.
	- erase previous contents of which-key buffer before inserting new
	 contents, and adjust buffer display in window by moving point to
	 the buffer's beginning

	Rename config variables, simplifying interface

	The primary config variable is now which-key-popup-type, which supports

	Refactor before work on window display

	Wanted to add support for using display-buffer or popwin, ran into some 
	bugs, had to make changes to the code so future work will be easier. 
	Details below:

	- separate between code to display window and code to populate buffer
	 contents
	- add `which-key-horizontal-buffer-height` similar to
	 `which-key-vertical-buffer-width`
	- abstract handling of different display methods into
	 `which-key/show-buffer` and `which-key/hide-buffer`, instead of mixed
	 in other functions
	- remove `which-key/make-display-method-aliases`
	- support two display methods: `minibuffer` and `side-window`, will add
	 popwin later
	- create start/stop functions for which-key--close-timer
	- a few other changes

	 foolproof and saves line space (I'm sure there's something wrong with
	 this).
